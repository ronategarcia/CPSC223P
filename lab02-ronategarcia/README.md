# Laboratory 2

## Laboratory Objectives
1. Explore and use various tools such as: GitHub, VirtualBox, Tuffix, Linux Terminal, and Atom.
1. Write a Python program using:
     1. lists
     2. loops
     3. conditional statements
     4. input/output
     5. modules
     6. functions
1. Run and test a Python program.

## Getting Started
1. Open the Terminal program in Tuffix.
1. Change the present working directory to the `Documents` directory by typing the following command at the command prompt:

    ```
    cd Documents
    ```

1. Make a copy of this Github repository on your computer using the `git` and `clone` commands that you will input to the terminal. The commands take a URL as a parameter to specify where it can get a copy of the repository. You can find the URL by clicking on the green *Clone or download* button at the top right part of this page. Copy the URL and replace the example text shown below. Note that `username` should be replaced with your own Github username. When you hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> it will ask you to provide your Github username and token. Once done, you will have a copy of the repository on your computer.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/CSUF-CPSC223P-STMAY-2022S/lab02-username.git
    ```
1. Navigate into the new directory using the command line. Note that `username` should be replaced with your own Github username.  As a shortcut, you can type the first few letters of the folder name and press <kbd>Tab</kbd> so that it auto completes the folder name for you.

     ```
     cd lab02-username
     ```
     
## Program Instructions
1. Write a Python program that performs as a Tuffy Titan Contact List which contains a list of contacts that can be modified or deleted.

1. Create a `contacts` module to meet the following requirements:
     1. Create a file named `contacts.py`.
     1. Add a comment at the top of the file which indicates your name, date and the purpose of the file.
     2. Note: All contact lists within this module should assume the list is of the form: `[["first name","last name"],["first name","last name"],...]`
     3. Define a function named `print_list` to meet the following requirements:
          1. Take a contact list as a parameter.
          2. Implement a docstring with a simple sentence that describes the function.
          3. Print a header for the printout which indicates the list index number, the first name, and the last name column headers.
          4. Loop through the contact list and print each contact on a separate line displaying: the list index number, the contact first name, and the contact last name.  Assuming `i` is the index value and `contacts` is the name of the list, the following will format the output: `print(f'{str(i):8}{contacts[i][0]:22}{contacts[i][1]:22}')`
     4. Define a function named `add_contact` to meet the following requirements:
          1. Take a contact list as a parameter.
          2. Implement a docstring with a simple sentence that describes the function.
          3. Prompt the user for the first name.
          4. Prompt the user for the last name.
          5. Add the contact to the list.
          6. Return the updated list.
     5. Define a function named `modify_contact` to meet the following requirements:
          1. Take a contact list as a parameter.
          2. Implement a docstring with a simple sentence that describes the function.
          3. Prompt the user for the list index number to modify. If the index it is not within the range of the contact list, print out `Invalid index number.` and return the unedited list.
          4. Prompt the user for the first name.
          5. Prompt the user for the last name.
          6. Modify the contact list at the index value.
          7. Return the updated list.
     6. Define a function named `delete_contact` to meet the following requirements:
          1. Take a contact list as a parameter.
          2. Implement a docstring with a simple sentence that describes the function.
          3. Prompt the user for the list index number to delete. If the index it is not within the range of the contact list, print out `Invalid index number.` and return the unedited list.
          5. Delete the contact at the index value.
          6. Return the updated list.
1. Create a `main` driver program to meet the following requirements:
     1. Create a file named `main.py`.
     1. Add a comment at the top of the file which indicates your name, date and the purpose of the file.
     1. Import the `contacts` module.
     2. Define a variable to use for the contact list. 
     3. Implement a menu within a loop with following choices:
          1. Print list
          2. Add contact
          3. Modify contact
          4. Delete contact
          5. Exit the program 
     4. Prompt the user for the menu choice and call the appropriate `contacts` function or exit the program.
1. Run the program using the command below and repeat the steps above until you are satisfied your program output meets the above requirements.

    ```
    python3 -m main
    ```


1. Typical input and output for the program:

1. Run the unit testing program to ensure that your program runs as expected.

    ```
    ./test.sh
    ```
       
    The unit testing will output the results of a series of tests using specific input and expected output.  Any error will provide information on where the expected output is different from the actual output.  You will need to edit your source code to fix the error and run `./test.sh` repeatedly until it passes all the test.

## Submission
Periodically throughout the exercise, and when you have completed the exercise, **submit the complete repository to Github**.

   <pre>git add .<br>git commit -m "<i>your comment</i>"<br>git push</pre>

In case it asks you  to configure global variables for an email and name, just copy the commands it provides then replace the dummy text with your email and Github token.

   <pre>git config --global user.email "<i>tuffy@csu.fullerton.edu</i>"<br>git config --global user.name "<i>Tuffy Titan</i>"<br>git commit -m "<i>your comment</i>"<br>git push</pre>

When you completed the final Github push, go back into github.com through the browser interface and ensure all your files have been correctly updated.  You should have the following files:
```
main.py
contacts.py
test.txt
```
