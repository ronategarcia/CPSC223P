# Laboratory 4

## Laboratory Objectives
1. Explore and use various tools such as: GitHub, VirtualBox, Tuffix, Linux Terminal, and Atom.
1. Write a Python program using:
     1. lists
     2. loops
     3. conditional statements
     4. input/output
     5. modules
     6. functions using positional and keyword arguments
     7. dictionaries
1. Run and test a Python program.

## Getting Started
1. Open the Terminal program in Tuffix.
1. Change the present working directory to the `Documents` directory by typing the following command at the command prompt:

    ```
    cd Documents
    ```

1. Make a copy of this Github repository on your computer using the `git` and `clone` commands that you will input to the terminal. The commands take a URL as a parameter to specify where it can get a copy of the repository. You can find the URL by clicking on the green *Clone or download* button at the top right part of this page. Copy the URL and replace the example text shown below. Note that `username` should be replaced with your own Github username. When you hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> it will ask you to provide your Github username and token. Once done, you will have a copy of the repository on your computer.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/CSUF-CPSC223P-STMAY-2022S/lab04-username.git
    ```
1. Navigate into the new directory using the command line. Note that `username` should be replaced with your own Github username.  As a shortcut, you can type the first few letters of the folder name and press <kbd>Tab</kbd> so that it auto completes the folder name for you.

     ```
     cd lab04-username
     ```
     
## Program Instructions
1. Write a Python program that performs as a Tuffy Titan Contact List which contains a list of contacts that can be modified or deleted.

1. Create a `contacts` module to meet the following requirements:
     1. Create a file named `contacts.py`.
     1. Add a comment at the top of the file which indicates your name, date and the purpose of the file.
     1. Note: All contact dictionaries within this module should assume a dictionary of the form: `{id: ['first', 'last'], id: ['first', 'last'], id: ['first', 'last']...}` where the id will be the phone number in this exercise.
     1. Note: All functions should implement a docstring with a simple sentence that describes the function.
     1. Define a function named `add_contact` to meet the following requirements:
          1. Take a contact dictionary as a positional parameter.
          1. Take a `id` as a keyword parameter.
          1. Take a `first_name` as a keyword parameter.
          1. Take a `last_name` as a keyword parameter.
          2. If the id exists in the dictionary, return the string `error`.
          3. Append the id:[first_name, last_name] key:value pair to the contact dictionary.
          4. Return the key:value pair that was added.
     1. Define a function named `modify_contact` to meet the following requirements:
          1. Take a contact dictionary as a positional parameter.
          1. Take a `id` as a keyword parameter.
          1. Take a `first_name` as a keyword parameter.
          1. Take a `last_name` as a keyword parameter.
          1. If the id does not exists in the dictionary, return the string `error`.
          1. Append the id:[first_name, last_name] key:value pair to the contact dictionary.
          1. Return the key:value pair that was added.
     1. Define a function named `delete_contact` to meet the following requirements:
          1. Take a contact dictionary as a positional parameter.
          1. Take a `id` as a keyword parameter.
          2. If the id does not exists in the dictionary, return the string `error`.
          3. Remove the key:value pair with the key equal to id.
          3. Return the key:value pair with the key equal to id.
     1. Define a function named `sort_contacts` to meet the following requirements:
          1. Take a contact dictionary as a positional parameter.
          2. Sort the dictionary in ascending order by last name, and then by first name, ignoring case.
          3. Return the sorted dictionary. 
     1. Define a function named `find_contact` to meet the following requirements:
          1. Take a contact dictionary as a positional parameter.
          1. Take a `find` as a keyword parameter.
          2. Create an empty dictionary.
          3. If find is a numeric value and contained as a key in the dictionary, add the key:value pair to the created dictionary.
          4. Loop through all the key:value pairs and if the find substring is contained in either the first name or last name, add the key:value pair to the created dictionary.
          5. Sort the created dictionary in ascending order by last name, and then by first name, ignoring case.
          6. Return the created dictionary. 
1. Create a `main` driver program to meet the following requirements:
     1. Create a file named `main.py`.
     1. Add a comment at the top of the file which indicates your name, date and the purpose of the file.
     1. Import the `contacts` module.
     2. Define a variable to use for the contact dictionary. 
     3. Implement a menu within a loop with following choices:
          1. Add contact
          1. Modify contact
          1. Delete contact
          1. Print contact list
          1. Find contact
          1. Exit the program
     4. Prompt the user for the menu choice.
     5. Prompt the user for the information needed for the appropriate `contacts` function and call the function.
     6. Print out appropriate errors with function return values of `error`.
1. Run the program using the command below and repeat the steps above until you are satisfied your program output meets the above requirements.

    ```
    python3 -m main
    ```


1. Typical input and output for the program:

1. Run the unit testing program to ensure that your program runs as expected.

    ```
    ./test.sh
    ```
       
    The unit testing will output the results of a series of tests using specific input and expected output.  Any error will provide information on where the expected output is different from the actual output.  You will need to edit your source code to fix the error and run `./test.sh` repeatedly until it passes all the test.

## Submission
Periodically throughout the exercise, and when you have completed the exercise, **submit the complete repository to Github**.

   <pre>git add .<br>git commit -m "<i>your comment</i>"<br>git push</pre>

In case it asks you  to configure global variables for an email and name, just copy the commands it provides then replace the dummy text with your email and Github token.

   <pre>git config --global user.email "<i>tuffy@csu.fullerton.edu</i>"<br>git config --global user.name "<i>Tuffy Titan</i>"<br>git commit -m "<i>your comment</i>"<br>git push</pre>

When you completed the final Github push, go back into github.com through the browser interface and ensure all your files have been correctly updated.  You should have the following files:
```
main.py
contacts.py
test.txt
```
    
## Grading
1. All points add up to a total of 100 points possible as detailed below.  Partial credit will be given where applicable.

| Points | Description |
| --- | --- |
|50|initial git clone of this repository to your Tuffix machine|
